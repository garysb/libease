Libease Release notes

##### 0.0.3 ##########


##### 0.0.2 ##########
This release of libease adds a variadic method to pass function paramaters into the
callback function. This lets you remove the variables that previously needed to be
defined in the global scope and pass them straight into the Easing library. For each
iteration of the easing method called, the variadic methods are copied and the copy
is then passed into the callback function.

All previous functions used for the callback will have to be remade to accept the
va_list paramater and then use va_arg to grab each variable passed in.

An example of how this works can be found in the ease.c test file. This passes
in an 'int' into the Ease library to tell us how often we have called an ease method
and passes in a 'char' to tell us which ease method we have chosen to run.
