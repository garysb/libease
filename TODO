1. Update the ease test file to integrate into autoconf. This will allow us to
   run tests using 'make installcheck' to check the library has been correctly
   installed and is working properly.

2. Change syntax used in libease.c to let us use the -Werror option when
   compiling libease. Currently it complains about the use of /=

3. Add some examples of how to use it. These should contain an example for some
   of the window managers, and also a python ctypes example. Maybe also make a
   php example for things like div offset placements.

4. Add more easing methods and also think about renaming our current ones to let
   us have diferent expressions for the same ease type. We could then add in
   a default expression type for the ease type. eg. 'easein' defaults to using
   the quadratic version.
